# The Lobby Backend - version 1.3.0

## Description

The Lobby is a long running project of mine, constantly being reinvented using new technologies and ideas. Initially the app was loosely inspired by Reddit, and slowly became a place where users could post content, and interact with other users' content (if I had made it publicly available). This iteration contains a reimagination of the Lobby's backend using Typescript and Node.js and is fully open source, anyone being allowed to clone it and use it it in their own projects. I will be updating the extensive README as I add more features and functionality. It is still in the early stages, and so far it contains full user authentication using JWT, search and CRUD operations for users, text posts and comments, likes for both posts and comments and customizable CORS handling. The next steps are to implement media content support and nested comment replies and I might take a break after to work on a different project.

-   A [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) database - [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/-PdjUx9JZ2E) (2:05 - 8:47)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/m1841/the-lobby-backend.git

```

2. Install the dependencies

```
PORT=[choose a port]
DATABASE_URI=[your mongodb database uri]
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=[any random string]
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=[any random string]

## Endpoints

### Auth

#### Login

`POST /api/auth/login`

-   Description: Authenticates a user by username or email (you only need to send one; if both are received, only the username is considered) and password, stores a refresh token in a cookie, and returns an access token. All the cookie handling is built in, so you don't have to worry about it. What you need to do is store the access token somewhere on the frontend, as you will need it to access protected routes.
-   Request Body: Contains a username (or email) and a password

    Example:

    ```
    {
        "username": "LilySmith82",

        }
        ```

#### Logout

`GET /api/auth/logout`

-   Description: Logs out the user by clearing the refresh token cookie and removing the token from the database to prevent it from being used after. You will also need to delete the access token from where you stored it on the frontend.

#### Refresh
