## Description

The Lobby is a long running project of mine, constantly being reinvented using new technologies and ideas. Initially the app was loosely inspired by Reddit, and slowly became a place where users could post content, and interact with other users' content (if I had made it publicly available). This specific repository contains a reimagination of the Lobby's backend using Typescript, Node.js & MongoDB. It is still in the early stages, and so far it contains full user authentication using JWT, CRUD operations for users and text posts and customizable CORS handling. The next steps are to implement media content support, likes, comments, followers, search and more. This project is fully open source and anyone is allowed to clone it and use it it in their own projects. I will be updating this README as I add more features and functionality. I also intend to deploy the API, using a dummy database, so that anyone can try it out without having to clone the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.16.1 or higher)
-   npm or other package managers
-   A [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) database - [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/-PdjUx9JZ2E) (2:05 - 8:47)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/m1841/the-lobby-backend.git
cd the-lobby-backend
```

2. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables ( replace the values with your own and remove the brackets)

```
PORT=[choose a port]
DATABASE_URI=[your mongodb database uri]
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=[any random string]
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=[any random string]
```

4. Add the URL of your frontend and backend to `config/allowedOrigins.ts` (I added some examples, feel free to delete them)

```
const allowedOrigins: string[] = [
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://localhost:5173"
];
```

5. Build and run the project

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

6. (Optional) If you want to run the project in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

## Endpoints

### Root

#### GitHub Redirect

`GET /`

-   Description: Redirects to the GitHub repository of the project
-   Request Body: `None`
-   Response Body: `None`

`GET /hello`

-   Description: Returns a simple "Hello World" message. This is just a test endpoint to make sure the server is running.
-   Request Body: `None`
-   Response Body: `Hello World!`

### Auth

#### Login

`POST /api/auth/login`

-   Description: Authenticates a user by username or email (you only need to send one; if both are received, only the username is considered), stores a refresh token in a cookie, and returns an access token. All the cookie handling is built in, so you don't have to worry about it. What you need to do is store the access token somewhere on the frontend, as you will need it to access protected routes.
-   Request Body:

```
{
    "username": "LilySmith82",
    "email": "lily_smith82@example.com",
    "password": "P@ssw0rd123"
}
```

-   Response Body if successful:

```

}
```

#### Logout

`GET /api/auth/logout`

-   Description: Logs out the user by clearing the refresh token cookie and removing the token from the database to prevent it from being used after. You will also need to delete the access token from where you stored it on the frontend.

-   Response Body: `None`

#### Refresh

`GET /api/auth/refresh`

-   Description: Refreshes the access token by checking if the refresh token is valid and returning a new access token if it is. You will need to store the new access token on the frontend and delete the old one.

```
{
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IndpbGx5MDEiLCJ1c2VySUQiOiI2NGJkMWRlZTc4YzYwNDZkYmVjNmI5OGMiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTAyOTU3NDgsImV4cCI6MTY5MDI5NjY0OH0.viNTz6BDc5hn1xpmqQZXr9qfWaZfWa1_hRHh5P9P-p4"
